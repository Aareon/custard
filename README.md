# custard

custard window manager

custard (stylized in all lowercase letters) is a stacking/floating window manager for X.Org. It arranges windows on a grid, i.e. there is a virtual grid on the screen, windows are positioned by X and Y coordinates, as well as sized over X and Y coordinates.

You could think of custard as a stacking/floating window manager that acts and looks more like a tiling window manager.

custard is based on subtle, 2bwm, swm, and howm. Some of the codebase was based off of code from the various projects listed, and as such, thanks, and credit where due to the creators of said projects.

# Notes

Note that as of commit 8256a056e638bf5a401c5870bc9f14d03d4f8c53, border types `Double` and `Triple` do not render properly. This should be fixed in the next few commits.
