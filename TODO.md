# To-do

1. Proper support for desktops, change desktop requests
2. Cache inner border values in window.cpp, rather than recalculating ever border update
3. Support for alpha transparency in borders

# Delayed

1. Add rounded borders (curved windows/shaped X windows), maybe?
1. Multimonitor support (I don't have a second monitor)
