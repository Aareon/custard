# To-do

1. Rewrite the fifo system to be more easily modifyable. Also, not use regular expressions? Adds a _lot_ of compilation time.
2. Rewrite config.cpp, make it more programmatic.
3. Add more support for `XCB_CONFIGURE_REQUEST`
4. Finish full-screen support
5. Update the man page
6. Rewrite for custardctl, it looks pretty bad.
7. Add rounded borders (curved windows/shaped X windows)?
