# To-do

1. Support two pixel sizes for borders, inner and outer
2. Proper support for desktops, change desktop requests
3. Cache inner border values in window.cpp, rather than recalculating ever border update
4. Support for alpha transparency in borders

# Delayed

1. Add rounded borders (curved windows/shaped X windows), maybe?
1. Multimonitor support (I don't have a second monitor)
