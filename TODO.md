# To-do

1. Remove FIFO in favor of an IPC
2. Make custard configurable via custardctl, after the IPC implementation
3. Proper support for desktop atoms, change desktop requests (ewmh)
4. Cache inner border values in window.cpp, rather than recalculating ever border update
5. Support for alpha transparency in borders

# Delayed

1. Add rounded borders (curved windows/shaped X windows), maybe?
1. Multimonitor support (I don't have a second monitor)
